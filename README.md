This repository was for the purpose of testing a succession of successions for AI training. It is based on a simple theft game, where it walks in a 10x10 matrix and has the purpose of finding the following rewards (coin, weapon and gasoline). Rewards are randomly distributed to the matrix, using randomness. The purpose of the game is to make you move the robot in a bi-demential way (x, y).

The game is being compiled in the terminal, so its interface is not user friendly for beginners.
